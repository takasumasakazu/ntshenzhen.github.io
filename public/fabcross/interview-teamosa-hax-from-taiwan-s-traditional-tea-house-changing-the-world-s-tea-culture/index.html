After that, we started a pre-ordered order at Indiegogo, which also accepted a back\nInterview: TEAMOSA(HAX) from Taiwan’s traditional tea house, changing the world’s tea culture Born in a family who runs a tea house in Taiwan and studied chemistry in the USA Irven started a hardware startup TEAMOSA with his older sister who learned system engineering and a brother — in — law who studied electronics. “I want to tell Westerners how to drink delicious genuine tea,” Irven’s products are full of Maker movement likeness.\nTEAMOSA is the startup of a freshly made Haya which just finished the tenth term of Hardware Accelerator HAX in the summer of 2017. I saw their demonstrations and presentations for the first time at HAX Asia Demo Day, held in Shenzhen on June 16, 2017.\n“Westerners do not know how to drink tea, tea is Earl Gray, etc. Many things smell after harvest, they have a lot of milk and sugar in it,A genuine tea is full of sweetness and aroma So, if you deliciously add good tea leaves, you can be satisfied without milk or sugar, which is healthier and the business that provides good tea should be successful in the West “and then tea is extracted by applying ultrasound to the tea leaves The presentation introducing the product TEAMOSA was impressive and interviewed on another day.\nCEO Irven**`s family runs a tea house in Taiwan** Irven: My parents have been running teahouses for 34 years in Taiwan. I have my own tea farm in Nantou County, Taiwan. The Taiwanese enjoy a variety of tea, but at my house I treat only oolong tea. It is a traditional teashop who does not deal with Pu’er tea or tea which is made only in China. I have been drinking parents’ tea since I was three years old.\nIrven: Both my sister and my sister went to Taipei, and after graduating from college I studied at an American graduate school. TEAMOSA is a family-run technology start-up, CEO I am a master of chemistry in the USA, my sister Kazarin Ph.D., system engineering Ph.D, her husband Ken acquires Ph.D. In 2016, I was thinking about ideas in the 10th year of American life. Starbucks bought a tea chain store called Teavana, and when I began to develop tea at Starbucks, I also went. It was not the scent of tea that was there. Earl Gray, Orange Peel, and all scent of perfume after all was aroma.\nMy idea that I felt at that time was “Why are Americans not the scent of tea?\nAmericans drink tea with tea bags. Even at luxury hotels and restaurants, if you order tea and bring it with a tea bag. Tea bags are usually made from poor quality tea like powder that remained under the box when making tea. Even high-end tea bags are of much lower quality than those sold in the same brand as tea leaves. Recent popular capsule coffee like Nespresso has tea such as milk tea, but it is not too high quality. It’s like enjoying a backfire fragrance or milk.\nIn the United States today tea is very major for health-oriented people, and PET bottle green tea is often drunk among Silicon Valley engineers. There is a possibility that the natural “genuine tea” without mixing may become more popular. Of course, there are further possibilities in Asia.\nWhat is genuine tea? Irven: There are six kinds of tea, but all are made from tea tree. For high-quality tea, tea leaves must first be of high quality.\nTherefore, the most important thing is the environment of the tea plant where tea leaves grow. The place where the temperature is not high and there is enough water is good. In Taiwan, tea that grows up in winter at about 2000 meters of high mountain and harvested in spring is the best. It gets bitter when sunshine is too strong.\nThe next important thing is the process after harvesting. After harvesting, rub the tea leaves, steam and ferment. Different fermentation and steaming, different tea such as white tea and black tea. In that sense “good tea leaves” are good or bad, but it is probably that they like the drinkers’ favorite, white tea or black tea or oolong tea.\nWhite tea: Not much in Taiwan. Harvest when white hair is budding on the surface of tea leaves\nGreen tea: Make it in Taiwan too. No fermentation. Japanese green tea is steamed, but in Taiwan it is often not steamed\nYellow tea: weak fermented tea\nOolong tea: semi-fermented tea. 90% of tea consumed in Taiwan is oolong tea\nBlack tea: tea etc. Fully fermented and dark\nPu’er tea: Fermented with special molds. Taiwanese people drink, but manufacturing is only in China\nOolong tea is said to be “semi-fermented tea”, but the range of half is wide. The famous “Oriental Beauty Tea” smells like flowers, but it is a fermented tea that does not steam as much as 80%, and that fragrance does not need to be added afterwards. Even the same 50% fermented oolong tea is completely different depending on whether it is steamed or steamed. There are many kinds of wine, but white wine and red wine are different grapes themselves. Tea is born entirely different kinds from the same tea leaves.\nIn Taiwan, oolong tea is often drunk 90%. Younger generations prefer different things, such as tea milk tea, which is a matter of style, so new oolong tea should be okay. The popular tapioca milk tea is put in the same tea leaves all day, so tea leaves are deteriorating at night. I think that you can put more delicious tea without cost too much. In the West, 80% is black tea, but green tea with vitamin C and antioxidant ingredients is becoming popular recently. Oolong tea also has its advantages.\nTEAMOSA as a product and business model Irven: I applied for HAX in October 2016 and was selected over about two months. The first proposal was a tea ceremony machine for business use as put in hotels and coffee shops. As a result of the interview with HAX, I decided to make home youth things that I could sell in the first place. If you make a huge success with Kickstarter, you will also be approaching a professional model.\nCoffee can be extracted at high temperature and high pressure, but if you do it with tea, tea cells will be broken. The process of putting in tea is a chemical reaction, the liquid water that touches the individual’s tea leaves turns into tea. The optimal temperature is different depending on the type of tea. When it is high-class Japanese tea gyokuro, it has an optimum temperature such as 60 degrees for green tea, 80 degrees for green tea and 90 to 95 degrees for oolong tea. TEAMOSA is further devising to extract extraction while maintaining the taste by applying ultrasound. Extraction is quickened by ultrasonic waves, and more body-friendly antioxidant components can be extracted.\nAs a business, in addition to the TEAMOSA machine, I’m thinking to sell tea capsules for 1 to 3 dollars. The inside of the capsule is the tea itself that is handled at my parent’s shop, it is not processing at all. A capsule is not necessarily necessary, it can also extract tea leaves on hand into TEAMOSA. The capsule is for the United States etc. where there is no tea house near the end. TEAMOSA is made to have good tea, so for those who do not have tea leaves, tea is also provided as a handy capsule. Pu’er tea which I do not handle at home parents also wants to find and provide partners.\nThe design of the machine is also closer to the traditional tea tool in China, and tea sea (Tea which saves tea and keeps concentration constant) is attached. I am promoting Kickstarter ’s cloud funding because I want to provide it for the US and Europe first, I have not experienced so good tea.\nTEAMOSA has amazing success on kickstarter TEAMOSA launched the Kickstarter campaign{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} on September 13, 2017 and finally got a total success of 274,457 dollars. After that, we started a pre-ordered order at Indiegogo{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor}, which also accepted a back order of 270,000 dollars and is still in campaign.\nTEAMOSA is hardware that had not existed in the past, “Slightly different from brand logo sticking to manufacturing of common parts”, And TEAMOSA is not something that can be manufactured using intermediate artifacts called Gongban, Gongmo.\nThe degree of manufacturing difficulty is high accordingly. Also, TEAMOSA as a company is the first to manufacture hardware, so even if the Kickstarter project succeeded, there are still many mountains to be successfully manufactured by September 2018 shipment. Furthermore, the success of a crowdfunding does not always mean that the growth of the company will succeed.\nStill, it is said that traditional tea house himself makes hardware products and delivers them directly to the Early Adapter is a typical example of the Maker movement. I am also looking forward to the update mail with support. I want to pay attention to the future of TEAMOSA.\nThis interview made the English version of what contributed to Fabcross{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} in Japan by the author.\nBy TAKASU Masakazu/高須正和{.p-author .h-card} on December 24, 2017.\nCanonical link Exported from Medium on February 6, 2026.\n",

<p>Born in a family who runs a tea house in Taiwan and studied chemistry in
the USA Irven started a hardware startup TEAMOSA with his older sister
who learned system engineering and a brother &mdash; in &mdash; law who studied
electronics. &ldquo;I want to tell Westerners how to drink delicious genuine
tea,&rdquo; Irven&rsquo;s products are full of Maker movement likeness.</p>

</p>
<p>TEAMOSA is the startup of a freshly made Haya which just finished the
tenth term of Hardware Accelerator HAX in the summer of 2017. I saw
their demonstrations and presentations for the first time at HAX Asia
Demo Day, held in Shenzhen on June 16, 2017.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Westerners do not know how to drink tea, tea is Earl Gray, etc. Many
things smell after harvest, they have a lot of milk and sugar in it,A
genuine tea is full of sweetness and aroma So, if you deliciously add
good tea leaves, you can be satisfied without milk or sugar, which is
healthier and the business that provides good tea should be successful
in the West &ldquo;and then tea is extracted by applying ultrasound to the tea
leaves The presentation introducing the product TEAMOSA was impressive
and interviewed on another day.</p>

<p><strong>Irven:</strong> My parents have been running teahouses for 34 years in
Taiwan. I have my own tea farm in Nantou County, Taiwan. The Taiwanese
enjoy a variety of tea, but at my house I treat only oolong tea. It is a
traditional teashop who does not deal with Pu&rsquo;er tea or tea which is
made only in China. I have been drinking parents&rsquo; tea since I was three
years old.</p>

sister Kazarin" loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><strong>Irven:</strong> Both my sister and my sister went to Taipei, and after
graduating from college I studied at an American graduate school.
TEAMOSA is a family-run technology start-up, CEO I am a master of
chemistry in the USA, my sister Kazarin Ph.D., system engineering Ph.D,
her husband Ken acquires Ph.D. In 2016, I was thinking about ideas in
the 10th year of American life. Starbucks bought a tea chain store
called Teavana, and when I began to develop tea at Starbucks, I also
went. It was not the scent of tea that was there. Earl Gray, Orange
Peel, and all scent of perfume after all was aroma.</p>
<p>My idea that I felt at that time was &ldquo;Why are Americans not the scent of
tea?</p>
<p>Americans drink tea with tea bags. Even at luxury hotels and
restaurants, if you order tea and bring it with a tea bag. Tea bags are
usually made from poor quality tea like powder that remained under the
box when making tea. Even high-end tea bags are of much lower quality
than those sold in the same brand as tea leaves. Recent popular capsule
coffee like Nespresso has tea such as milk tea, but it is not too high
quality. It&rsquo;s like enjoying a backfire fragrance or milk.</p>
<p>In the United States today tea is very major for health-oriented people,
and PET bottle green tea is often drunk among Silicon Valley engineers.
There is a possibility that the natural &ldquo;genuine tea&rdquo; without mixing may
become more popular. Of course, there are further possibilities in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-genuinetea"><strong>What is genuine tea?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-genuinetea">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Irven:</strong> There are six kinds of tea, but all are made from tea tree.
For high-quality tea, tea leaves must first be of high quality.<br>
Therefore, the most important thing is the environment of the tea plant
where tea leaves grow. The place where the temperature is not high and
there is enough water is good. In Taiwan, tea that grows up in winter at
about 2000 meters of high mountain and harvested in spring is the best.
It gets bitter when sunshine is too strong.<br>
The next important thing is the process after harvesting. After
harvesting, rub the tea leaves, steam and ferment. Different
fermentation and steaming, different tea such as white tea and black
tea. In that sense &ldquo;good tea leaves&rdquo; are good or bad, but it is probably
that they like the drinkers&rsquo; favorite, white tea or black tea or oolong
tea.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hwFM6lw2jx5hhU7ljZyhsw.png" alt="Irvine explain to me about six kind
of tea." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><strong>White tea:</strong> Not much in Taiwan. Harvest when white hair is budding on
the surface of tea leaves<br>
<strong>Green tea:</strong> Make it in Taiwan too. No fermentation. Japanese green
tea is steamed, but in Taiwan it is often not steamed<br>
<strong>Yellow tea:</strong> weak fermented tea<br>
<strong>Oolong tea:</strong> semi-fermented tea. 90% of tea consumed in Taiwan is
oolong tea<br>
<strong>Black tea:</strong> tea etc. Fully fermented and dark<br>
<strong>Pu&rsquo;er tea:</strong> Fermented with special molds. Taiwanese people drink, but
manufacturing is only in China</p>
<p>Oolong tea is said to be &ldquo;semi-fermented tea&rdquo;, but the range of half is
wide. The famous &ldquo;Oriental Beauty Tea&rdquo; smells like flowers, but it is a
fermented tea that does not steam as much as 80%, and that fragrance
does not need to be added afterwards. Even the same 50% fermented oolong
tea is completely different depending on whether it is steamed or
steamed. There are many kinds of wine, but white wine and red wine are
different grapes themselves. Tea is born entirely different kinds from
the same tea leaves.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, oolong tea is often drunk 90%. Younger generations prefer
different things, such as tea milk tea, which is a matter of style, so
new oolong tea should be okay. The popular tapioca milk tea is put in
the same tea leaves all day, so tea leaves are deteriorating at night. I
think that you can put more delicious tea without cost too much. In the
West, 80% is black tea, but green tea with vitamin C and antioxidant
ingredients is becoming popular recently. Oolong tea also has its
advantages.</p>

<h3 id="teamosa-as-a-product-and-businessmodel"><strong>TEAMOSA as a product and business model</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#teamosa-as-a-product-and-businessmodel">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Irven:</strong> I applied for HAX in October 2016 and was selected over about
two months. The first proposal was a tea ceremony machine for business
use as put in hotels and coffee shops. As a result of the interview with
HAX, I decided to make home youth things that I could sell in the first
place. If you make a huge success with Kickstarter, you will also be
approaching a professional model.</p>
<p>Coffee can be extracted at high temperature and high pressure, but if
you do it with tea, tea cells will be broken. The process of putting in
tea is a chemical reaction, the liquid water that touches the
individual&rsquo;s tea leaves turns into tea. The optimal temperature is
different depending on the type of tea. When it is high-class Japanese
tea gyokuro, it has an optimum temperature such as 60 degrees for green
tea, 80 degrees for green tea and 90 to 95 degrees for oolong tea.
TEAMOSA is further devising to extract extraction while maintaining the
taste by applying ultrasound. Extraction is quickened by ultrasonic
waves, and more body-friendly antioxidant components can be extracted.</p>
<p>As a business, in addition to the TEAMOSA machine, I&rsquo;m thinking to sell
tea capsules for 1 to 3 dollars. The inside of the capsule is the tea
itself that is handled at my parent&rsquo;s shop, it is not processing at all.
A capsule is not necessarily necessary, it can also extract tea leaves
on hand into TEAMOSA. The capsule is for the United States etc. where
there is no tea house near the end. TEAMOSA is made to have good tea, so
for those who do not have tea leaves, tea is also provided as a handy
capsule. Pu&rsquo;er tea which I do not handle at home parents also wants to
find and provide partners.</p>
<p>The design of the machine is also closer to the traditional tea tool in
China, and tea sea (Tea which saves tea and keeps concentration
constant) is attached. I am promoting Kickstarter &rsquo;s cloud funding
because I want to provide it for the US and Europe first, I have not
experienced so good tea.</p>

<p>TEAMOSA launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamosa/teamosa-your-personal-tea-brewing-master">the Kickstarter
campaign</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor} on September 13, 2017 and finally got a total success
of 274,457 dollars. After that, we started a pre-ordered order at
<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/teamosa-your-personal-tea-brewing-master">Indiegogo</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor}, which also accepted a back order of 270,000 dollars
and is still in campaign.</p>
<p>TEAMOSA is hardware that had not existed in the past, &ldquo;Slightly
different from brand logo sticking to manufacturing of common parts&rdquo;,
And TEAMOSA is not something that can be manufactured using intermediate
artifacts called Gongban, Gongmo.<br>
The degree of manufacturing difficulty is high accordingly. Also,
TEAMOSA as a company is the first to manufacture hardware, so even if
the Kickstarter project succeeded, there are still many mountains to be
successfully manufactured by September 2018 shipment. Furthermore, the
success of a crowdfunding does not always mean that the growth of the
company will succeed.</p>
<p>Still, it is said that traditional tea house himself makes hardware
products and delivers them directly to the Early Adapter is a typical
example of the Maker movement. I am also looking forward to the update
mail with support. I want to pay attention to the future of TEAMOSA.</p>
