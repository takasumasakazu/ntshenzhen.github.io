My activity report, almost all my activity in July is join that program,
called research at scale in Dongguang, Shenhzen, China.

I spend 3 weeks on Dongguang and Shenzhen, with MIT/Todai researchers
and Chinese factory and Agent. I have some experience about this area
and making thinks, but these 3 weeks are caused different my mindset
about that. The Makers and Shenzhen have more opportunities. Making is
same as research something. I still think again about that after the
program, that is so huge impact for me...

Hooray! Make Magazine recovered! I write up report about the Manila Mini
Maker Faire! I still improve each other Maker Movement in Asia.
