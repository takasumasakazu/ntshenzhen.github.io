Japanese Maker Pro, five times bigger in this four years, &mldr; And still growing!


Japanese Maker Pro (Indie Hardware) is grown rapidly.
Switch Science sells Japanese Maker Pro Product (Indie Hardware) sales
have been five times over the past four years.
Of course, Indie Hardware is sold at various DIY events in Japan besides
Switch Science. It is thought that the market as a whole continues to
grow.
Moreover, there is still a possibility in this market. Even numbers that
are five times larger are only 0.1 percent of Indie Manga in
Japan(Japanese Indie Manga Market is over 700 million doller per year).
The current figure of 610,000 dollars is a small figure. But what if it
is only 0.1 percent? And which is larger with Manga, hardware and market
size?
Indie Hardware in Japan has endless possibilities."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/shenzhen/japanese-maker-pro-five-times-bigger-in-this-four-years-and-still-growing-b788f1ba96f/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/shenzhen/japanese-maker-pro-five-times-bigger-in-this-four-years-and-still-growing-b788f1ba96f/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://takasumasakazu.github.io/shenzhen/japanese-maker-pro-five-times-bigger-in-this-four-years-and-still-growing-b788f1ba96f/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website"><meta property="og:title" content="Japanese Maker Pro, five times bigger in this four years, ...
