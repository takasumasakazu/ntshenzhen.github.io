This is Takasu,

I have left from Shenzhen for Chinese New Year, and also CES and BETT.\
After that, Now I\`m in Japan for maker event. Then I will be in Tokyo
for the Lecture, about Maker\`s ecosystem, Maker Pro, Chinese IP system
and DIY communities.

This is my first time, part-time lecture in WASEDA Univ, I prepare for
15 time talk in MBA and economy student, sounds a bit challenging. But I
have interest about that, my DIY and grassroots attitude will discuss to
MBA and economy student, I am really looking to see the new challenge
for my brain.

After lecture, finally I got 2 week holiday, I\`m planning to go Bohol
island for only diving and re-fresh.

I will be back to Shenzhen at the end of Feb, and heads up to SXSW
Austin.

See you there!
