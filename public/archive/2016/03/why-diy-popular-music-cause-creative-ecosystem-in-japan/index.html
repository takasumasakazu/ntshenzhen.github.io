<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rCv-lxLY--SR7iz4SNODPQ.png" alt="Vocaloid{.markup&ndash;anchor .markup&ndash;figure-anchor} software by YAMAHA." loading="lazy" />
{.graf-image}</p>
<p>Voice Synthesizer called Vocaloid is famous software technology. For
represented example HATSUNE MIKU, that software made Google theme song,
such as famous singer Lady Gaga. That tune &lsquo;Tell your world&rsquo; played
almost 5 million times.</p>
<p>Google Chrome Theme song [Tell your world]</p>
<p>In fact, that HATSUNE MIKU and any Vocaloid are just voice synthesizing
software, like other Synthesizer play by musician such as Daft punk.
Apart from other software, Vocaloid was a singing a song with lyric.
That cause big movement in Japan, a lot of DIY tune makers born in
Japan, and over thousands professional quality music video shared in
Japanese video sharing service. Indeed, you can see that creative
collaboration ecosystem in these Vocaloid movements, likewise imagine
open source movement. Actual HATSUNE MIKU is not an open source,
technology by YAMAHA, Voice source by Voice actor Saki Fugita, product
of Cripton future media. But similar software UTAU is open source, and
these Vocaloid songs, making a trough of the process are very similarly
culture as open source community.<br>
**Who made these high quality music videos? Why that creative ecosystem
appears in the Japanese video sharing service?<br>
**This essay will try to express that.</p>
<h4 id="9e84" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" name="9e84">What is DIY popular music? Why Vocaloid software is important?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9e84">#</a></h4>
<p>Computer music by amateur musician and the hobbyist is not new things,
you can see hobby computer music history before 1990. <br>
But typical computer musics before the Vocaloild, these songs are
instrumental music, such as DJ and electro style, No singing and lyric.</p>
<p>Famous computer music &lsquo;Extra&rsquo; by Ken Ishii.</p>
<p>Almost popular music need singing with lyrics, you can find tune in hit
chart, Pitbull, Coldplay, OK GO, so every popular music have singing.
Vocaloid softwares cause popular music bring to the Computer music, then
the hobbyist can make popular music from them only the laptop, without
physical singers and band.<br>
Hence The laptop song makers are able to make popular music tune by
Vocaloid. Additionally that Vocaloid software has character and
appearance, like real Singer.<br>
The early days, that the character and appearance are only one picture.
However, that picture combined songs and lyrics, these became a story.
Next, That stories&rsquo; cause imagines people, especially other creators,
such as a drawer, Movie makers, bloggers. Finally, The song makers and
other creators start collaboration for making movie clip together. That
is an ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="d389" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" name="d389">What is Ecosystem? Why an Ecosystem is important?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#d389">#</a></h4>
<p>That movie structure includes beautiful movie, picture and appearance.
These things by DIY but not only track maker, collaboration by three
different people. Produced and music by KUROUSA-P, Illustrated by
ITTOMARU, movie by MIENOHITO. They are individual hobbyist meet on the
Net. You can see a lot of collaboration in Vocaloid scene, for example,
that SENBON SAKURA is 24st song from KUROUSA-P.<br>
Typical Vocaroid song makers called &lsquo;P&rsquo;. P means Producer. He makes a
song and lyric, and producing his song, also a collaboration with
illustrator and movie maker to build the songs vision of the world.</p>
<p>SENBON SAKURA most popular song in 2011</p>
<p>This DIY song SENBON SAKURA played million times in only 42 days, at
2011. That means so many people enjoy Vocaloid songs. In case of Karaoke
in Japan in 2011, almost every hit tunes are by Vocaloid.</p>
<p>These audiences in Video sharing service, some people are able to create
another song and pictures, videos. Them added on a more and more story
for the original Vocaloid character. Then, HATSUNE MIKU getting a lot of
stories of the songs and pictures, start from only one picture, by
<strong>collaborative creation</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="ead6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" name="ead6">Collaborative creation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ead6">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Music select system of democratic collaboration.</strong><br>
Notable Vocaloid songs are almost 1500 songs in video sharing service.
These are chosen from so many (uncountable) DIY computer music by the
hobbyist song maker.<br>
If you see all the songs, Probably you can find only low quality music,
feel boring quickly, such as ATARI Shock.But you can find notable songs.</p>
<p>How to choose that notable songs?<br>
First, Vocaloid mania checks every uploaded song at Video sharing
service. That is not so easy, because every day 100&ndash;300 per day new
song uploaded in 2011 (2009&ndash;2012 are Vocaloid songs golden era) And
they not only watch the song, but also they add tagging songs and make
song lists and publish to the blog every day. People can see Vocaloid
hit chart every day.<br>
Second, listed tunes are played by so many Vocaloid listeners, mostly
teenager. <br>
Finally, some song played over 100,000 times, that song called notable.
Every person can make and choose any songs, that is so democratic
collaboration.</p>
<p>**Why people doing a collaboration for creative?<br>
**Example SENBON SAKURA is 24st songs by Kurousa-P. He did 24 times
collaboration with illustrator and movie maker.<br>
Why people doing a collaboration for creative? Of course, The create
music process is sometimes fun, additionally big audience in Internet
give positive power to the creators. However, that is not only fun,
creators spend many time on his laptop, then sometime that effort can&rsquo;t
make anything. These things too hard to call only hobby.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TeZ-EVh7s9IrymlHLy2a1A.png" alt="These are Senbon Sakura&rsquo;s alternative creation in Japanese
illustration community. You can find a lot of alternative creation in
Japanese online
community." loading="lazy" />
{.graf-image}</p>
<p>Otherwise, people often help each other for the purpose, indeed for the
community. Vocaloid is only software, voice and simple character. Hence
the creators add more story for the character. Now every famous Vocaloid
has quite an attractive personality, more the every real singer.
Meanwhile them Vocaloid personality is made by collaborative creation.</p>
<p>**Shared Personality<br>
**A real singer, such as Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga&rsquo;s personality is
belonging them. You can&rsquo;t feel own Lady Gaga&rsquo;s personality. In the case
of some musician give the name to them music instrument, Eric Crapton
calling his guitar Layla. Otherwise that guitar Layla&rsquo;s only his one.<br>
Apart from, a Vocaloid is different. They have a personality from
collaboration, and that software shared by each creator. Therefore them
personality didn&rsquo;t monopoly by anybody, every creator has own Singer.
Vocaloid has both of apparently contradictory, they have shared
personality.</p>
<h4 id="6372" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" name="6372">Open collaboration ecosystem.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6372">#</a></h4>
<p>In conclusion, the people surrounding Vocaloid are making ecosystem.
They helped each other for growing ecosystem. Additionally centre of
ecosystem in attractive personality of Vocalid, that is not only
software synthesizer but also character. As well as them character made
by collaborative creation.<br>
That structure is a bit similar to open source projects, unless
difference between a software and content.<br>
These are not a cathedral and not a bazaar, but another kind of open
collaboration ecosystem.
