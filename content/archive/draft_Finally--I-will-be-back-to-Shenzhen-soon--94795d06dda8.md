I told on COSCON'20 Chinese Open Source CONference. I saw that Open
Source movement in China growing so rapidly. That huge supported from
the government and a tech giant company, that sounds bit different Open
Source in Westen countries, but also interesting.

Shenzhen is one of the most areas about Open Source in China, because of
IoT. Some Chinese company such as Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, they are
released new embedded OS and software by Open Source. That is the new
chapter of Open Source hardware.

The Maker Movement is a part of the Open Source movement. I will explore
this theme.

I can\`t wait to tell you more innovation and technology from there,
hope to see you soon.
