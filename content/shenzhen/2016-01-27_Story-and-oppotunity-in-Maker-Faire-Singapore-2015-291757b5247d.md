Maker Faire Singapore 2015 digest

I really like that video, Maker Faire Singapore 2015 digest.

Here Singapore is a very small country, only 5.5million population in
whole of the nation. Bit difficult to find a tech enthusiast such as
Tokyo, difficult to find cool startup such as Shenzhen.

But you can see a lot of enjoy making kids and females in there.

MFSG is provided from Ministry of Education, we focused on kids and
parents Maker Faire.

We started with kids and parents 5years ago.

But Maker culture in Singapore glowing very first, We have over 30 maker
spaces in this red dot on the map's nation. In 2015, our Maker Faire
reached with Hobby DIY enthusiast group in the world. Some DIY group in
Singapore and worldwide, making the booth in there.

During this year, we will make Maker Faire with Singapore Univercity
Technology and Science.

Finally, our Maker Faire reach to Science, open source, more research
field.

We can find more opportunity in Maker Faire Singapore. And we can make
together unlimited opportunity.
