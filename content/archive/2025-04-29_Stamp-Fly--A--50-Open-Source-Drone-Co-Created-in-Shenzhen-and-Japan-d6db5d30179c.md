**Why We Built Stamp Fly**

Professor Kohei Ito from Kanazawa Institute of Technology was searching
for a programmable drone that could be used in the classroom. Existing
products were either too fragile, too expensive, or closed-source. The
team at M5Stack had previously attempted to launch a drone kit called
Atom Fly --- but it fell short in durability and functionality.

**What Went Wrong with Atom Fly**

The original Atom Fly had a lightweight frame made from PCB material,
which cracked easily in test flights. The microcontroller, ATOM Lite,
lacked enough I/O pins for sensor expansion. Attempts were made to
reinforce the frame and improve firmware, but the platform couldn't
handle reliable, repeatable flight --- especially in an educational
setting.

**How Japan Revived the Project**

Japanese hardware hacker GOROman prototyped a hybrid: Atom Fly's
electronics inside a BETAFPV 65mm drone frame --- a major upgrade in
durability. Simultaneously, M5Stack released the M5Stamp S3, a smaller
and more powerful board that enabled easier sensor integration.
Professor Ito contributed deep expertise in flight control, and the
firmware was made open-source to allow further development. Together,
Japanese engineers and Shenzhen suppliers collaborated at startup speed
to bring the kit to life.

**Inside the Stamp Fly Hardware**

Stamp Fly is powered by the ESP32-S3-based M5Stamp S3, paired with
brushless motors, BETAFPV propellers, and a LAVA 1S battery. It connects
via the M5ATOM Joystick --- a custom-built controller with a screen that
shows battery level and pairing status. And yes, even the controller is
fully programmable.

**Where It's Being Used Now**

Stamp Fly is now used in intensive five-day university classes to teach
flight control and PID tuning. It's also catching attention from the
ArduPilot community and DIY drone builders. The kit is fully
open-source, from firmware to PCB design, allowing remixing and deep
learning.

**The Value of Cross-Border Open Hardware**

This project is a success story of hardware made fast in Shenzhen and
refined by Japanese engineering. It shows how open-source principles and
international maker culture can create real, scalable educational tools.
