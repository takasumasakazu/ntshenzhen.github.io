Well known most active hardware accelerator HAX, Them Lab is located in
Shenzhen.\
HAX started 11th batch now, So rush and excited feeling in the office.\
He Anant is program manager of HAX, He came from India for joining HAX a
year ago. He has also excited new batch.

We saw a many of the project those graduates from HAX, such as Nomiku,
Makeblock, Wazer, and so many things, these are evidence of what HAX
did.\

That 180 days program is only for Chinese startups by some Chinese
Menter in HAX, Zona, Qiyu, and others, yes they are a global team. HAX
program 180 days for a Chinese startup bring to the US and Euro, by them
produce and promote, also marketing.\
International program for 15 startups are twice of year, Chinese program
for 10 startups for once of year, I will see 40 new projects from HAX
per year.

HAX still continue them way rapidly, called 'SHENZHEN SPEED'.
