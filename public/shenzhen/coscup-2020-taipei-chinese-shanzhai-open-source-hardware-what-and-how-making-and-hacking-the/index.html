COSCUP 2020 Taipei &lsquo;Chinese Shanzhai Open source Hardware, what and how making and hacking the manufacturing model?&rsquo;
Abstract
Well known Chinese style copycat called SHANZHAI (山寨), and Chinese
original style open source hardware model called GONGKAI (公開) named by
bunnie are still living. Now Shanzhai engineer and entrepreneurs are
helping to Chinese tech giant such as Xiaomi, Oppo and hacking AI robot.

Now Shanzhai engineer and entrepreneurs are helping to Chinese tech giant such as Xiaomi, Oppo and hacking AI robot.\nI try to explain about that, Where Shanzhai come from? Investigate them ecosystem and value in modern IoT development?\nThey Shanzhai hacked What? How they hacked the Manufactualing?\nIf you find a product in TAOBAO, you can get them PCBA design like download from Github. And if you release a new product in TAOBAO, somebody sends pull request for you like to customize an offer, you can choose\n1. Sell PCBA\n2. Customized by yourself\n3. Somebody makes a copycat by your product.\nShanzhai is a Chinese style, innovation model.\nHistory of Origin In 1990, when China starts to develop, not manufacturing, some Chinese SoC distributors find new business model. If the distributor SoC on the PCBA by chipset reference design, that a better sales than only source. Many Chinese developers didn`t have enough skill to use SoC, but they can make cell phone from the PCBA. They are the origin of Shanzhai, small but freedom unskilled developer make funny cell phone like Phone with the shaver. Few thousand Shanzhai PCBA companies in Shanghai, Xiamen, and Shenzhen. Shanghai and Xiamen are most of SoC company like Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Shenzhen is the most of cellphone company.\nGlow and distilled A few thousand small company distilled to few tech giants, like Oppo, VIVO, Huawei and so on. Now over half of world top 10 smartphone company are located in Shenzhen. Shenzhen also reformed, City of Shanzhai to Chinese Silicon Valley.\nShanzhai distributor also changed the name, they called IDH (Independent Design House) now. Current IDH is a huge company like Xiaomi, one IDH hired few thousand engineers.\nToday`s Shanzhai Business model Why Apple make only high-end smartphone, only one or two model in each year? Why Xiaomi and Oppo, and other Chinese company make Low, Middle, High totally 10 new smartphone release each 3 months? Their developer team is smaller than Apple.One reason is Shanzhai.\nMany Chinese tech giants, they outsourced the design of the smartphone to IDH. Middle and low spec smartphone`s are not designed by Xiaomi. Xiaomi in-house designer focus only top-end model.\nExample, Famous IDH Wiingtech design 83 million smartphone in 2017. And Chinese tech giants still use IDH. 80% Xiaomi`s smartphones design that outsourced by IDH, also Lenovo` 70%, TCL:25%, Meizu:95%, Huawei:38%…\nWhy they can outsource, but Apple cannot? Middle and Low spec smartphone is another market, like Africa and Asia. They prefer cost affordable, but also need good smart phone. And every Middle and Low spec smartphone gets better day by day by Moore`s law. That means if the company can quick time to market new tech (nearly new SoC), that can make a profit. This is the market for Chinese Shanzhai ecosystem, by tech giant and IDH.\nModern Shanzhai not any pirate to the patients, but them ecosystem still make profit for the company in China.\nOther style Shanzhai Business Many factories make, new product by themselves. That means many innovations born in there. The current Chinese company sells an original product, they also sold only PCBA. This is the example company called City easy made communication robot, that robot small succeed in the market, and City easy also sell only PCBA.\nWhy Cityeasy sell PCBA for copycat? In fact, Cityeasy robot is made by Smartspeaker + Balancewheeler + Tablet, they compile commodity technology, and make complicated product. Cityeasy access other hardware design resource by PCBA, and Rip, Mix, Burn, then made them Original product.\nEach commodity technology is under Moore`s law. They showed them idea to profit ASAP. That is the reason why Cityeasy running two sales channels, PCBA for B2B and product for B2C.\nThis is the backstage, why many new hardware products came from quickly from Shenhzen.\nConclusion Chinese ShanZhai IP sharing system is transformed.\nCurrent ShenZhai became more regal and distilled for IoT (Internet of Things) product.\nIDH and Shared IP are fit for Mass customization. The current modern development board is also Open Source Hardware.\nThat means We should consider how share more, how pushes the open source movement in our Society.\nReference 差別化を諦めた｢垂直分裂｣のバリューチェーンで実現した異端のものづくり――現代中国・イノベーションの最前線 — Kouta Takaguchi\nhttps://gemba-pi.jp/post-179927\nハードウェアのシリコンバレー深圳に学ぶ -Junichi Fujioka book 2016\nInterview with Chinese entrepreneur for Kickstarter and Chinese copycat\nhttps://medium.com/shenzhen-high-tour-by-makers/shanzhai-b9b718f6158a\nWhy Shenzhen is amazing in the maker movement — TAKASU Masakazu\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/takasu/why-shenzhen-is-amazing-in-maker-movement\nThe Hardware Hacker — bunnie Huang book 2017\nhttps://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=4297\nThe $12 “Gongkai” Phone -bunnie\nThe $12 \"Gongkai\" Phone \" bunnie's blog\n*How cheap can you make a phone?

<p>Well known Chinese style copycat called SHANZHAI (山寨), and Chinese
original style open source hardware model called GONGKAI (公開) named by
bunnie are still living. Now Shanzhai engineer and entrepreneurs are
helping to Chinese tech giant such as Xiaomi, Oppo and hacking AI robot.</p>
<p>I try to explain about that, Where Shanzhai come from? Investigate them
ecosystem and value in modern IoT development?</p>
<p>They Shanzhai hacked What? How they hacked the Manufactualing?</p>
<p>If you find a product in TAOBAO, you can get them PCBA design like
download from Github. And if you release a new product in TAOBAO,
somebody sends pull request for you like to customize an offer, you can
choose</p>
<p>1. Sell PCBA<br>
2. Customized by yourself<br>
3. Somebody makes a copycat by your product.</p>
<p>Shanzhai is a Chinese style, innovation model.</p>

<h3 id="history-oforigin"><strong>History of Origin</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#history-oforigin">#</a></h3>
<p>In 1990, when China starts to develop, not manufacturing, some Chinese
SoC distributors find new business model. If the distributor SoC on the
PCBA by chipset reference design, that a better sales than only source.
Many Chinese developers didn`t have enough skill to use SoC, but they
can make cell phone from the PCBA. They are the origin of Shanzhai,
small but freedom unskilled developer make funny cell phone like Phone
with the shaver. Few thousand Shanzhai PCBA companies in Shanghai,
Xiamen, and Shenzhen. Shanghai and Xiamen are most of SoC company like
Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Shenzhen is the most of cellphone company.</p>
<h3 id="glow-and-distilled"><strong>Glow and distilled</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#glow-and-distilled">#</a></h3>
<p>A few thousand small company distilled to few tech giants, like Oppo,
VIVO, Huawei and so on. Now over half of world top 10 smartphone company
are located in Shenzhen. Shenzhen also reformed, City of Shanzhai to
Chinese Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Shanzhai distributor also changed the name, they called IDH (Independent
Design House) now. Current IDH is a huge company like Xiaomi, one IDH
hired few thousand engineers.</p>
<h3 id="todays-shanzhai-businessmodel"><strong>Today`s Shanzhai Business model</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#todays-shanzhai-businessmodel">#</a></h3>
<p>Why Apple make only high-end smartphone, only one or two model in each
year? Why Xiaomi and Oppo, and other Chinese company make Low, Middle,
High totally 10 new smartphone release each 3 months? Their developer
team is smaller than Apple.One reason is Shanzhai.</p>
<p>Many Chinese tech giants, they outsourced the design of the smartphone
to IDH. Middle and low spec smartphone`s are not designed by Xiaomi.
Xiaomi in-house designer focus only top-end model.</p>
<p>Example, Famous IDH Wiingtech design 83 million smartphone in 2017. And
Chinese tech giants still use IDH. 80% Xiaomi`s smartphones design that
outsourced by IDH, also Lenovo` 70%, TCL:25%, Meizu:95%, Huawei:38%&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="why-they-can-outsource-but-applecannot"><strong>Why they can outsource, but Apple cannot?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-they-can-outsource-but-applecannot">#</a></h3>
<p>Middle and Low spec smartphone is another market, like Africa and Asia.
They prefer cost affordable, but also need good smart phone. And every
Middle and Low spec smartphone gets better day by day by Moore`s law.
That means if the company can quick time to market new tech (nearly new
SoC), that can make a profit. This is the market for Chinese Shanzhai
ecosystem, by tech giant and IDH.</p>
<p>Modern Shanzhai not any pirate to the patients, but them ecosystem still
make profit for the company in China.</p>

<h3 id="other-style-shanzhaibusiness"><strong>Other style Shanzhai Business</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#other-style-shanzhaibusiness">#</a></h3>
<p>Many factories make, new product by themselves. That means many
innovations born in there. The current Chinese company sells an original
product, they also sold only PCBA. This is the example company called
City easy made communication robot, that robot small succeed in the
market, and City easy also sell only PCBA.</p>
<p>Why Cityeasy sell PCBA for copycat? In fact, Cityeasy robot is made by
Smartspeaker + Balancewheeler + Tablet, they compile commodity
technology, and make complicated product. Cityeasy access other hardware
design resource by PCBA, and Rip, Mix, Burn, then made them Original
product.</p>
<p>Each commodity technology is under Moore`s law. They showed them idea
to profit ASAP. That is the reason why Cityeasy running two sales
channels, PCBA for B2B and product for B2C.</p>
<p>This is the backstage, why many new hardware products came from quickly
from Shenhzen.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>Chinese ShanZhai IP sharing system is transformed.</p>
<p>Current ShenZhai became more regal and distilled for IoT (Internet of
Things) product.</p>
<p>IDH and Shared IP are fit for Mass customization. The current modern
development board is also Open Source Hardware.</p>
<p>That means We should consider how share more, how pushes the open source
movement in our Society.</p>
