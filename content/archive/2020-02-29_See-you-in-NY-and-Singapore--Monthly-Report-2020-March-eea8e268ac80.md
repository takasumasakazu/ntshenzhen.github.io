### See you in NY and Singapore! Monthly Report 2020/March {#21ac .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="21ac"}

Long time no see, I\`m not able to send monthly reports from Shenzhen,
because too much trip.

Now I\`m in Bangkok, Thailand for Holiday, I enjoyed last two weeks in
Myanmar and Thailand. So surprising in Yangon, I saw few so active Maker
Space there. I got interested in a marker event in Yangon next 2021 Jan.

And I did 15 times lecture in WASEDA Univ in Japan. I\`m an associate
lecturer there, talk about Mass innovation from Shenzhen. I invite some
guest talk in my lecture, you can see our friend, Jie Qi talk about MIT
Media Lab / TODAI in Shenzhen and the story of her.

still stay there until 17th, please meet and greet me in NY. Over there,
