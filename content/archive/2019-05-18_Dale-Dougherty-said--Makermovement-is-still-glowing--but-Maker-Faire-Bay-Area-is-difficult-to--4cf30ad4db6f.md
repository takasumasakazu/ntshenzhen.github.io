I heard from MakerMedia CEO Dale (And also my good friend, I still
respect and big hand to him)today at a press conference in Maker Faire
Bay Area.\
This news is true.

engineers for more than a decade, but next
week\'s...*www.sfchronicle.com](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Next-week-s-Maker-Faire-in-San-Mateo-could-be-13836040.php?psid=5fi3m#photo-10106992 "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Next-week-s-Maker-Faire-in-San-Mateo-could-be-13836040.php?psid=5fi3m#photo-10106992"){.markup--anchor

The MAKER is still valuable, and maker movement is still growing. But
MFBA is a bit difficult by financing.

MFBA is not so profitable event for the company. If the changing a theme
for more profitable, like the AI Faire, or STEM Faire, the event will
get more sponsors for continuing. But that is not at MakerFaire, mostly
Maker Faire Bay Area.

And other city\`s Maker Faire like NewYork and Tokyo, Maker Faire is
still getting well. Their city\`s Ecosystem by the makers are still
increasing. But in the MFBA, fire and cyberpunk from all over the world
to the San Mateo event centre, that is difficult to run the show without
big Sponsor. Thus, this style MFBA is difficult to find a way.

The press conference is only 3 journalist likes me, and QA is only
around 10 min. I felt that is the shadow of the phenomenon, from the
Silicon Valley people\`s interest to the MFBA.

In other city is different. Maker movement and Maker Faire are so
valuable for people on the earth, mostly my homeland China, Japan, and
Southeast Asia, but here in Silicon Valley, "Value" mean\`s only the
money.

Sponsor.....](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EgE9xT9Lr_tTP1IE0TWIGw.jpeg)

This year MFBA is a bit smaller than last 2 years, however still
beautiful. I hope to see the MFBA mind to spread in the world.

I really like this event, I came to MFBA on five times, include 3 times
by my only personal wallet from Asia to San mateo.

I attached the sound file about interview with Dale, on the press
conference.
