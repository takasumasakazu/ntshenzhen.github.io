They hold a tour to introduce the manufacturing network to the startup twice a year. I will introduce the situation of the tour and manufacturers of the supply chain at prototype / small lot stage.\nHWTrek is a support company for Makers. They make networks to connect the following 33 together and make business as matching.\n· Startup: Although there are ideas and product seeds, we can not yet deliver the products to the market\n· Manufacturer: It is capable of producing startup products.\n· Expert: It is a specialist who can solve startup problems, but it does not make products by oneself.\nThis is list.You can see whole process from Prototype to Product.\nSkyPrototype{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (CNC,Resin Cast, small lot prototype)\nChinaPCBOne{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (PCB, PCBA)\nEMTECH{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (Certification, Test)\nShenzhen valley ventures{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (Incubator, accelerator, MakerSpace)\nInvox/Sun On{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (Molding)\nteamGiant (Battely)\nRyder (EMS)\nStephen Gould{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} (Packaging)\nNothing that can not be made here Shenzhen supply chain\nThis time they participated in a tour to guide the supply chain to the startup, and I saw Shenzhen being called a world factory. I saw seven different factories in 3 days, but the following points are common.\n· Every manufacturer has world-class level design, production and problem solving skills\n· Flexible and quick response\n· Higher level of confidentiality, such as checking belongings by whole body counter at entrance of factory\n· Contracts can be tied in English\n· Perhaps the price range is higher in Shenzhen, but there is no feeling that cost is spent on unnecessary places and high price with no brand name is added with brand name\n· Current business partners are lined with famous manufacturers including famous companies in Japan, Europe and the US\nSince it is obvious in Shenzhen that it is early / cheap to some extent, I felt that it is characterized by being reliable in terms of quality and delivery time, and being able to respond flexibly to ambiguous orders of startups. In this report, we will introduce the incubator and cutting company, from “prototype to productization”.\nShenzhen Valley Ventures “prototype to productization”.\nStart-ups will commercialize “ideas not found anywhere in the world”.\nFrom a mass-production company’s point of view, it will be “to make products not found anywhere in the world”. It is a challenging story from the experience of a mass production company.\nMany products that the nominated start-up worked on failed at the mass production stage.\nShenzhen Valley Ventures is an incubator operated by ZOWEE, a super-biggest manufacturing company like FOXCONN, which makes business to support startup like this participant. Besides Shenzhen, there is an office in Silicon Valley as well, it is a business model like the reverse of HAX (from San Francisco with lab in Shenzhen) to introduce American resources to a company in China.\nOf course, as HAX is also investing in Chinese companies, Shenzhen Valley Ventures also invests in the start-up in the world other than the United States, and it seems that the ratio between the United States and China is exactly half. We have incubated the startup with a span of about 6 months and 10 labs have already used this lab just opened two weeks ago.\nIn this Maker space just created, an engineer who can give advice such as design and inspection for mass production which is missing in the start-up resides and as shown in the presentation movie, “As Makers trying to actually make a business, not a hobby The place for “is provided. DMM.make AKIBA is close in Japan in the case of professional, but it is the first time to prepare for Maker space up to a small production line like Shenzhen.\nSKY Prototype 1 to 1000\nSkyPrototype is a milling company. In trial production in Chinese, it often refers to “making one by one” with cutting and 3D printers, rather than “trying on a trial.” Injection molding commonly used in mass production first uses a lot of money to make a “mold” and pours plastic into it to make the exterior. It is cheap enough to make as much as possible, but the initial cost is necessary, once you make the mold, it is difficult for you to fix it, it is not suitable for use such as “make only 10 pieces and try to exhibit at the exhibition”.\nProcess 3D printers and cutting processes one by one.\nEven if one or even 1000, the cost per one will not change, initial investment will not be applied. Even if it finally mass-produces and lines up in a mass merchandiser, even if it is necessary for exhibitions and cloud funding, use cutting work and gather feedback several times until the mistake is not made, It is a good choice to raise money for investment.\nSkyPrototype performs small lot processing with 1 to several thousands as a catch phrase, and many engineers ride in consultation. If you inform us of the exterior CAD data and application, the necessary number etc., we will consider the material, processing method, finishing method etc. together. Since that consulting service is an incidental work of manufacturing, it is free, communication is also roughly in English. The factory has machines and craftsmen who can do various processes for that purpose, and exchange is said to start from “sending prototype first”.\nOf course, not only prototype but SkyPrototype is handling products, such as finished products of automobile gear boxes, which require accuracy and material that CNC can not deliver even if the cost rises somewhat. First of all, there are a lot of representative machines for small lot production and various CNCs. A large number of CNCs with different roles, such as machines capable of complicated machining such as gouging, large machines capable of producing large parts, such as 4 axes and 5 axes, line up.\nAlso, while making small lots as core, they make it scalable to even a little more requests. For example, it also provides a resin cast that molds resin by making molds with silicone rubber, plastic, aluminum, etc, and also provides a lathe and drilling engineer to make even less items than CNC.\nAs you can see from the photographs up to now, although there are many machine tools, SkyPrototype and other strengths of Shenzhen companies are also able to respond flexibly by craftsmanship plus the number of people. Many employees have started working since age 18 and the average age of the factory is 25 years old. So far Shenzhen was a place where workers concentrated from all over China, but now it is also the place with the highest land and salary in China. SkyPrototype is considering moving to Xiamen (Xiamen) as the next one. In Xiamen, the quality of the workers does not change so much, but it seems that the operating cost of the factory will be reduced by 30%.\nInvox/Sun On Synbol of Manucatcurling\nInjection molding, making metal exteriors in large quantities using metal molds is a synonym for mass production. Many of fabcross’s readers will recognize that the mold is as expensive and valuable as to be an asset.\nSun On Group of Dongguan City is its injection molding factory. Founded in 1997, currently counts 1,000 employees and has sold $ 45 million. We produce and output 150 to 200 project dies per month, 30% of whom are foreign clients.\nThe difficult point for injection molding is that it can not be fixed at a later time.\nSun On Group sells proposal power by preparing engineers who are familiar with all the manufacturing processes and repeating prototyping before raising the mold. For example, when undertaking injection molding of a water dispenser, output a prototype using a 3D printer that can output large items, and verify that “it can be properly used in this form and water flows”. The 3D CAD data is shared with the client, and of course you can send prototypes by mail.\nAn estimate including the prototype cost is presented at the initial exchange of “what to use for what kind of requirement specification” and the interaction on the way is included in the final output fee.\nThe black part of the exterior of the cell phone in this picture is made of injection molded plastic. It is necessary to fasten the screws, but cutting the screw threads to plastic becomes uneasy in terms of strength.\nSun On proposed a structure fitting a threaded metal nut and made it “work well” from all aspects of strength, cost and ease of manufacture. Since this is inside it does not matter that the texture and color are different.\nIn order to solve various problems on Sun On, there are not only injection molding but also all molding lines including aluminum casting and pressing.\nComposite materials molding\nAluminum parts molding\nPainting after molding\nFor Sun On to speak, “One order ends with an overnight line operation, there are rarely people waiting for customers.”\nIt is the most time-consuming aspect of how to output what exactly what kind of material is output after CAD data of the exterior is brought in. In about a month and a half, one project is over.\nSun On’s factory also has a small assembly line, brought boards and electronic circuit parts from others and sometimes undertakes work to make it finished here. I feel that it is Shenzhen-like business style where accumulated know-how of various factories.\nEMTEK Certification\nThe difference between the products that line up in the store and the prototype that startup makes is the quality including safety. To line up with mass merchandising stores, it is necessary to ensure security including certification by the certification body of each country. EMTEK provides comprehensive inspection / Certification services.\nFounded in 2000, EMTEK currently has annual sales of $ 24.6 million annually, and 5 to 6 new products are handled monthly. In famous places, Takara Tomy’s toys have been inspected here, which seems to be a 15% cost savings compared to the former vendor. In addition, it is a big company with nineteen support offices around the world including inspection of the new model BB — 8 of the robot toy used to connect with the smartphone Sphero here.\nIn EMTEK, FCC, CE and technical suitability can be taken at one factory, but this is also consulting here as well, considering the optimum plan by product and budget. Those that are closely attached to the skin like a smartphone and loaded with various wireless equipments require a variety of tests, which is said to be a case of a smart phone development in the United States, it took only 60,000 dollars for the inspection process. What kind of inspection is done is the know-how of EMTEK, the more expensive the inspection is, the more expensive it is, but the problem is discovered later and the risk of product recall is lowered. It is one of the values ​​of EMTEK to propose inspection plans by stepping into what kind of products and what users use.\nThe time to create a test plan and end the test is on average 3 to 4 weeks. There are also premises to break the product during the test, so if you have about 3 to 4 samples, it will be over in that period, but with only one there seems to be more time.\nTeamGiant (Battely) and Stephen Gould(Packaging and Shipment)\nIn Shenzhen, packing service companies that undertake final stages of manufacturing, companies that make batteries themselves from scratch are all within the range that any service necessary for the manufacturing industry can be accessed.\nShenzhen’s battery maker teamGiant is a company that can process raw materials and make battery cells themselves. In addition to batteries that can withstand approximately 500 charging used in general electronic devices such as smart phones, they also manufacture high-life batteries that can withstand over 2000 charges used in electric vehicles and the like.\nThe factory has been almost automated, it is possible to observe but the inside can not be taken. We also customize automation monitoring system for our company. The company’s strength is the high performance of the basic battery cell, which is created by hiring a lot of doctors and masters, and the quality of testing the safety by leaving the completed battery charged for 48 hours for safety. At the time of the test, 2000 charging cycles are done in-house, and the barcode attached to the battery of the finished product contains not only the date of manufacture and lot, but also information on where the material was purchased , And devised so that quality can be further improved when there is a problem. If you just paste labels etc. using existing battery cells, if you are going to adjust the capacity, voltage, size etc from small hundreds of small lot and make a completely custom battery, assuming a capacity of 5000 mA, It can be developed from about a piece. If the capacity is bigger like those used for electric cars, the number is small, and as the capacity is small like the one put in the action camera, the number increases.\nLastly I visited Stephen Gould of the American capital, a service company that packs and delivers packages with a printing factory as the core. Also at the entrance of the factory, there is a whole body counter like before you board an airplane, you can not bring in or take anything to the factory. Here we undertake many national clients, such as GoPro, Parrot of Drone, Japanese companies such as Panasonic, etc., in Shenzhen.\nEverything is handled in Stephen Gould, of course, until it is printed / bound in paper manuals, printed in cosmetic boxes, made in boxes, packed in boxes, delivered together in a cardboard for shipping, of course, We are also doing a few things for exhibitions etc.\nA huge printing factory is located in Dongguan City, a bonded area located in the border area of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, where we store / ship products from customers, even if we decide to pack products made in Thailand etc. here, Taxes brought to China are not charged. Shenzhen / Hong Kong is close to Southeast Asia, and it seems to be using that locality well.\nI saw whole of process in here Shenzhen, from Prototype to Product\nThe 3 days I experienced this time was a tour to see the accumulation of enormous manufacturing industry accumulated from all over the world in the last 30 years.\nIn Shenzhen you can receive all services from prototype to shipment in a place where you can hear. It seemed that they were motivated to commercialize “the work which is not in the world, the first work” which was able to be able to talk in English in all the visited companies and it was flexible. Regardless of a standalone dealer, its accumulation is only in Shenzhen. Also, HWTrek will not introduce it, but if you search by yourself, you will find lots of cheaper suppliers. I think that scalability is also the result of accumulation.\nThe integration increases the quality and the cost decreases. The factory operation cost in the Shenzhen area has been rising year by year, but it seems that the merit of progressing accumulation has been won for a while for a while. In terms of individual vendors, there are many places where they are considering relocating to Xiamen (Amoy) or Malaysia. Shenzhen is also a location that can be their hub.\nIn fact, many of the factories are no longer “Shenzhen City” but are moving to neighboring Dongguan City, etc. The center of Shenzhen City has become a city with higher added value such as financial district and service. If you are in Dongguan you can do the same thing as Shenzhen, it is another challenging goal whether to have the same quality when you move the factory to Xiamen and even overseas. Japanese companies have many such experiences, but Chinese companies will experience it from now.\nNonetheless, the future will be more globalized. It will be more urbanized and more merit will come out. The role will change, but it seems that it will continue to be in the place where “for the time being let’s go to Shenzhen” for startup for a while.\nBy TAKASU Masakazu/高須正和{.p-author .h-card} on December 31, 2016.\nCanonical link Exported from Medium on February 6, 2026.\n",

<p>HWTrek is doing business that connects world startup and mainly Shenzhen
manufacturer. They hold a tour to introduce the manufacturing network to
the startup twice a year. I will introduce the situation of the tour and
manufacturers of the supply chain at prototype / small lot stage.</p>

</p>
<p>HWTrek is a support company for Makers. They make networks to connect
the following 33 together and make business as matching.</p>
<p>· Startup: Although there are ideas and product seeds, we can not yet
deliver the products to the market<br>
· Manufacturer: It is capable of producing startup products.<br>
· Expert: It is a specialist who can solve startup problems, but it does
not make products by oneself.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing that can not be made here Shenzhen supply chain</strong></p>
<p>This time they participated in a tour to guide the supply chain to the
startup, and I saw Shenzhen being called a world factory. I saw seven
different factories in 3 days, but the following points are common.</p>
<p>· Every manufacturer has world-class level design, production and
problem solving skills<br>
· Flexible and quick response<br>
· Higher level of confidentiality, such as checking belongings by whole
body counter at entrance of factory<br>
· Contracts can be tied in English<br>
· Perhaps the price range is higher in Shenzhen, but there is no feeling
that cost is spent on unnecessary places and high price with no brand
name is added with brand name<br>
· Current business partners are lined with famous manufacturers
including famous companies in Japan, Europe and the US</p>
<p>Since it is obvious in Shenzhen that it is early / cheap to some extent,
I felt that it is characterized by being reliable in terms of quality
and delivery time, and being able to respond flexibly to ambiguous
orders of startups. In this report, we will introduce the incubator and
cutting company, from &ldquo;prototype to productization&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Shenzhen Valley Ventures &ldquo;prototype to productization&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Start-ups will commercialize &ldquo;ideas not found anywhere in the world&rdquo;.<br>
From a mass-production company&rsquo;s point of view, it will be &ldquo;to make
products not found anywhere in the world&rdquo;. It is a challenging story
from the experience of a mass production company.<br>
Many products that the nominated start-up worked on failed at the mass
production stage.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Valley Ventures is an incubator operated by ZOWEE, a
super-biggest manufacturing company like FOXCONN, which makes business
to support startup like this participant. Besides Shenzhen, there is an
office in Silicon Valley as well, it is a business model like the
reverse of HAX (from San Francisco with lab in Shenzhen) to introduce
American resources to a company in China.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*95nSSdCsuHFSkQ79ronzbg.jpeg" alt="Maker space just finished. Besides co-working space, in addition to a
full-scale prototype development environment, it also has a sports gym
and

</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DZmZRk6ntGk3JRVBNH2ujA.jpeg" alt="High performance CNC machine. Many machine tools are in huge space
such as 4 axis and 5 axis CNC, lathe, 3D

</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*r5bm5THp5pIaT1wO0scGUQ.jpeg" alt="Shenzhen Valley Ventures&rsquo; prototyping space has small production
lines." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>Of course, as HAX is also investing in Chinese companies, Shenzhen
Valley Ventures also invests in the start-up in the world other than the
United States, and it seems that the ratio between the United States and
China is exactly half. We have incubated the startup with a span of
about 6 months and 10 labs have already used this lab just opened two
weeks ago.</p>
<p>In this Maker space just created, an engineer who can give advice such
as design and inspection for mass production which is missing in the
start-up resides and as shown in the presentation movie, &ldquo;As Makers
trying to actually make a business, not a hobby The place for &ldquo;is
provided. DMM.make AKIBA is close in Japan in the case of professional,
but it is the first time to prepare for Maker space up to a small
production line like Shenzhen.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SKY Prototype 1 to 1000</strong></p>
<p>SkyPrototype is a milling company. In trial production in Chinese, it
often refers to &ldquo;making one by one&rdquo; with cutting and 3D printers, rather
than &ldquo;trying on a trial.&rdquo; Injection molding commonly used in mass
production first uses a lot of money to make a &ldquo;mold&rdquo; and pours plastic
into it to make the exterior. It is cheap enough to make as much as
possible, but the initial cost is necessary, once you make the mold, it
is difficult for you to fix it, it is not suitable for use such as &ldquo;make
only 10 pieces and try to exhibit at the exhibition&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Process 3D printers and cutting processes one by one.<br>
Even if one or even 1000, the cost per one will not change, initial
investment will not be applied. Even if it finally mass-produces and
lines up in a mass merchandiser, even if it is necessary for exhibitions
and cloud funding, use cutting work and gather feedback several times
until the mistake is not made, It is a good choice to raise money for
investment.</p>
<p>SkyPrototype performs small lot processing with 1 to several thousands
as a catch phrase, and many engineers ride in consultation. If you
inform us of the exterior CAD data and application, the necessary number
etc., we will consider the material, processing method, finishing method
etc. together. Since that consulting service is an incidental work of
manufacturing, it is free, communication is also roughly in English. The
factory has machines and craftsmen who can do various processes for that
purpose, and exchange is said to start from &ldquo;sending prototype first&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, not only prototype but SkyPrototype is handling products,
such as finished products of automobile gear boxes, which require
accuracy and material that CNC can not deliver even if the cost rises
somewhat. First of all, there are a lot of representative machines for
small lot production and various CNCs. A large number of CNCs with
different roles, such as machines capable of complicated machining such
as gouging, large machines capable of producing large parts, such as 4
axes and 5 axes, line up.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Tramt0XhrGP-CwlLzWzOfA.jpeg" alt="CNC, computer numerical control processing machine. Cut aluminum,

</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wO6qYZL-eys_BN3w3jAHWw.jpeg" alt="They can also process plastics, so we are also delivering items by combining aluminum scraped parts and plastic parts.

medical equipment casings, and those that are used as it is as finished
products." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>Also, while making small lots as core, they make it scalable to even a
little more requests. For example, it also provides a resin cast that
molds resin by making molds with silicone rubber, plastic, aluminum,
etc, and also provides a lathe and drilling engineer to make even less
items than CNC.</p>

</p>
<p>As you can see from the photographs up to now, although there are many
machine tools, SkyPrototype and other strengths of Shenzhen companies
are also able to respond flexibly by craftsmanship plus the number of
people. Many employees have started working since age 18 and the average
age of the factory is 25 years old. So far Shenzhen was a place where
workers concentrated from all over China, but now it is also the place
with the highest land and salary in China. SkyPrototype is considering
moving to Xiamen (Xiamen) as the next one. In Xiamen, the quality of the
workers does not change so much, but it seems that the operating cost of
the factory will be reduced by 30%.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Invox/Sun On Synbol of Manucatcurling</strong></p>
<p>Injection molding, making metal exteriors in large quantities using
metal molds is a synonym for mass production. Many of fabcross&rsquo;s readers
will recognize that the mold is as expensive and valuable as to be an
asset.<br>
Sun On Group of Dongguan City is its injection molding factory. Founded
in 1997, currently counts 1,000 employees and has sold $ 45 million. We
produce and output 150 to 200 project dies per month, 30% of whom are
foreign clients.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fHMNSe5zcNb4Zg1SHkFVcg.jpeg" alt="This whole area Sun On Group factory. Various injection molding
processes
line up." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>The difficult point for injection molding is that it can not be fixed at
a later time.<br>
Sun On Group sells proposal power by preparing engineers who are
familiar with all the manufacturing processes and repeating prototyping
before raising the mold. For example, when undertaking injection molding
of a water dispenser, output a prototype using a 3D printer that can
output large items, and verify that &ldquo;it can be properly used in this
form and water flows&rdquo;. The 3D CAD data is shared with the client, and of
course you can send prototypes by mail.<br>
An estimate including the prototype cost is presented at the initial
exchange of &ldquo;what to use for what kind of requirement specification&rdquo; and
the interaction on the way is included in the final output fee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7U40_BnCVTv_dCbp4gnMQw.jpeg" alt="Examples of consulting. They proposed an idea to solve the screw part
by embedding
metal parts." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>The black part of the exterior of the cell phone in this picture is made
of injection molded plastic. It is necessary to fasten the screws, but
cutting the screw threads to plastic becomes uneasy in terms of
strength.<br>
Sun On proposed a structure fitting a threaded metal nut and made it
&ldquo;work well&rdquo; from all aspects of strength, cost and ease of manufacture.
Since this is inside it does not matter that the texture and color are
different.<br>
In order to solve various problems on Sun On, there are not only
injection molding but also all molding lines including aluminum casting
and pressing.</p>
<p>Composite materials molding</p>
<p>Aluminum parts molding</p>
<p>Painting after molding</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dLV98zwBFtH2BPCl4VgEmg.jpeg" alt="A mold and a lathe line up. All the craftsmen are young. Shenzhen mold
engineers often start working from the age of 18 and many engineers in
the middle of the twenties who have a career of seven to eight years
are working." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0lVPT3vMyCSLHG3BDTG-QA.jpeg" alt="When I heard that the startup using the wearable equipment that took
part in the tour &ldquo;How much would it cost if I output this part?&rdquo;, After
interchanging the material and painting story a couple of times, it is
&ldquo;About 30,000 RMB?&rdquo; $ 4000) &ldquo;as soon as the standard of expenses
came back." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>For Sun On to speak, &ldquo;One order ends with an overnight line operation,
there are rarely people waiting for customers.&rdquo;<br>
It is the most time-consuming aspect of how to output what exactly what
kind of material is output after CAD data of the exterior is brought in.
In about a month and a half, one project is over.</p>
<p>Sun On&rsquo;s factory also has a small assembly line, brought boards and
electronic circuit parts from others and sometimes undertakes work to
make it finished here. I feel that it is Shenzhen-like business style
where accumulated know-how of various factories.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EMTEK Certification</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the products that line up in the store and the
prototype that startup makes is the quality including safety. To line up
with mass merchandising stores, it is necessary to ensure security
including certification by the certification body of each country. EMTEK
provides comprehensive inspection / Certification services.</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, EMTEK currently has annual sales of $ 24.6 million
annually, and 5 to 6 new products are handled monthly. In famous places,
Takara Tomy&rsquo;s toys have been inspected here, which seems to be a 15%
cost savings compared to the former vendor. In addition, it is a big
company with nineteen support offices around the world including
inspection of the new model BB &mdash; 8 of the robot toy used to connect
with the smartphone Sphero here.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wye2s4KSJJtFo8TNJisYFA.jpeg" alt="You can see many of
famous company" loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vom9EQBfyamQ5wFIT79yHg.jpeg" alt="EMTEK &rsquo;s 10 m radio anechoic chamber. There are more than 10 test
rooms in total, including 3 electromagnetic anechoic rooms. Besides
Shenzhen there are inspection facilities in Ningbo, Dongguan
and others." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dlJibBdprIU9zPV3ulOiOw.jpeg" alt="EMTEK has various inspection machines such as waterproof, dustproof,
pollution and vibration. They think the inspection plan according
to clients." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>In EMTEK, FCC, CE and technical suitability can be taken at one factory,
but this is also consulting here as well, considering the optimum plan
by product and budget. Those that are closely attached to the skin like
a smartphone and loaded with various wireless equipments require a
variety of tests, which is said to be a case of a smart phone
development in the United States, it took only 60,000 dollars for the
inspection process. What kind of inspection is done is the know-how of
EMTEK, the more expensive the inspection is, the more expensive it is,
but the problem is discovered later and the risk of product recall is
lowered. It is one of the values ​​of EMTEK to propose inspection plans
by stepping into what kind of products and what users use.</p>
<p>The time to create a test plan and end the test is on average 3 to 4
weeks. There are also premises to break the product during the test, so
if you have about 3 to 4 samples, it will be over in that period, but
with only one there seems to be more time.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TeamGiant (Battely) and Stephen Gould(Packaging and Shipment)</strong></p>
<p>In Shenzhen, packing service companies that undertake final stages of
manufacturing, companies that make batteries themselves from scratch are
all within the range that any service necessary for the manufacturing
industry can be accessed.</p>
<p>Shenzhen&rsquo;s battery maker teamGiant is a company that can process raw
materials and make battery cells themselves. In addition to batteries
that can withstand approximately 500 charging used in general electronic
devices such as smart phones, they also manufacture high-life batteries
that can withstand over 2000 charges used in electric vehicles and the
like.</p>
<p>The factory has been almost automated, it is possible to observe but the
inside can not be taken. We also customize automation monitoring system
for our company. The company&rsquo;s strength is the high performance of the
basic battery cell, which is created by hiring a lot of doctors and
masters, and the quality of testing the safety by leaving the completed
battery charged for 48 hours for safety. At the time of the test, 2000
charging cycles are done in-house, and the barcode attached to the
battery of the finished product contains not only the date of
manufacture and lot, but also information on where the material was
purchased , And devised so that quality can be further improved when
there is a problem. If you just paste labels etc. using existing battery
cells, if you are going to adjust the capacity, voltage, size etc from
small hundreds of small lot and make a completely custom battery,
assuming a capacity of 5000 mA, It can be developed from about a piece.
If the capacity is bigger like those used for electric cars, the number
is small, and as the capacity is small like the one put in the action
camera, the number increases.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RhajlX6r71R5I5MGW4LkMA.jpeg" alt="TeamGiant also provides batteries for electric vehicles with high
difficulty. There are many electric car companies
in China." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d10hphano_TtqqIu1JK4-A.jpeg" alt="TeamGiant employs many master / doctoral degrees, and develops new
technology for
batteries." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>Lastly I visited Stephen Gould of the American capital, a service
company that packs and delivers packages with a printing factory as the
core. Also at the entrance of the factory, there is a whole body counter
like before you board an airplane, you can not bring in or take anything
to the factory. <br>
Here we undertake many national clients, such as GoPro, Parrot of Drone,
Japanese companies such as Panasonic, etc., in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Everything is handled in Stephen Gould, of course, until it is printed /
bound in paper manuals, printed in cosmetic boxes, made in boxes, packed
in boxes, delivered together in a cardboard for shipping, of course, We
are also doing a few things for exhibitions etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZFO5I3OcAQ-migAA_kPEVw.jpeg" alt="This can be opened and closed with a cardboard box, a plastic hanger,
another fabric like fur inside, a magnet, and a cover with vividly
printed photographs stamped on another material He is the one who took
the first place at the factory, but if thousands of units are available,
it can be manufactured at about
3 dollars." loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>A huge printing factory is located in Dongguan City, a bonded area
located in the border area of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, where we store /
ship products from customers, even if we decide to pack products made in
Thailand etc. here, Taxes brought to China are not charged. Shenzhen /
Hong Kong is close to Southeast Asia, and it seems to be using that
locality well.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I saw whole of process in here Shenzhen, from Prototype to Product</strong></p>
<p>The 3 days I experienced this time was a tour to see the accumulation of
enormous manufacturing industry accumulated from all over the world in
the last 30 years.</p>
<p>In Shenzhen you can receive all services from prototype to shipment in a
place where you can hear. It seemed that they were motivated to
commercialize &ldquo;the work which is not in the world, the first work&rdquo; which
was able to be able to talk in English in all the visited companies and
it was flexible. Regardless of a standalone dealer, its accumulation is
only in Shenzhen. Also, HWTrek will not introduce it, but if you search
by yourself, you will find lots of cheaper suppliers. I think that
scalability is also the result of accumulation.</p>
<p>The integration increases the quality and the cost decreases. The
factory operation cost in the Shenzhen area has been rising year by
year, but it seems that the merit of progressing accumulation has been
won for a while for a while. In terms of individual vendors, there are
many places where they are considering relocating to Xiamen (Amoy) or
Malaysia. Shenzhen is also a location that can be their hub.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the factories are no longer &ldquo;Shenzhen City&rdquo; but are
moving to neighboring Dongguan City, etc. The center of Shenzhen City
has become a city with higher added value such as financial district and
service. If you are in Dongguan you can do the same thing as Shenzhen,
it is another challenging goal whether to have the same quality when you
move the factory to Xiamen and even overseas. Japanese companies have
many such experiences, but Chinese companies will experience it from
now.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the future will be more globalized. It will be more
urbanized and more merit will come out. The role will change, but it
seems that it will continue to be in the place where &ldquo;for the time being
let&rsquo;s go to Shenzhen&rdquo; for startup for a while.</p>
