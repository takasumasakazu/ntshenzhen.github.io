### Maker Faire Shenzhen 2016, at the most AGILE city Shenzhen. {#990b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="990b"}

Asia's largest Maker Faire is being held in Shenzhen, the center of the
world's hardware · China.

"Maker Faire Shenzhen 2016" which was scheduled from 21 to 23 October
2016 became an unprecedented Maker Faire that the schedule will be
changed from 23 to 24 days before the actual day due to the height of
hugest typhoon.

There are 100,000 participants and it seems like a dream to change the
schedule of huge events to be held outdoors immediately.

It was at Maker Faire that made it a flag of "Agile", Seeed and others
because of people in Shenzhen.

![Maker Faire Shenzhen 2016 gathered 100,000 visitors in two days,
ending with a great success. Even though That county well known prone to
pricing, statistical figures, the commemorative check-in using SNS at
the entrance started from scratch and exceeded 10000. Most people seemed
to be entering without checking in, so 100,000 visitors
are nodding.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Z3CW1KWXDqWY0gaXUwmxA.jpeg)

**Mega Typhoon hits Maker Faire Shenzhen.**

The giant typhoon Haima that hit Maker Faire Shenzhen 2016, which was
originally planned to be held from October 21 to 23, was the 21st of the
first day of the landing, and "Signal 8" signifying the suspension of
transportation and enterprise activity Was informed by the government.
It is like official class closure of all Hong Kong and giant city
Shenzhen of scale compared to Tokyo.

The Maker Faire is done mainly outdoors. Even in Shenzhen, a huge tent
created with jacked up frames was lined outdoors. Since it is a large
tent, it was decided to re-install on the 22nd when the typhoon passed
after all the tents set up on the 20th were all lowered to the ground.

![Venue just before typhoon. It was necessary to disassemble all of the
huge tent and gates at the entrance, which we assembled with great
effort
all day.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G1H2ogGVdhRd9h3h2XczOQ.jpeg)

![In re-establishing 23rd, Maker Faire Shenzhen 2016 the
first day.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TYrLLW7yXEp1svrcjys1ng.jpeg)

Since the re-establishment, I finished the place which originally takes
about 2 days in one day with the construction work. Still Maker Faire
can only be held on the 23rd. The MFSZ steering committee extended Maker
Faire, one day in a hurry under the decision of President Eric Pan, the
main sponsor, and decided to change the schedule on both the 23rd and
24th.

Maker Faire in outdoor public space is suddenly extended for one day.
Venue, equipment, guests, announcements, enormous in a moment --- work
to the extent of puncturing --- occur. There was "Maker Faire's original
task (Indoor lecture did not change so much)" "Tasks to be changed (if
the guest is not attached by airplane, it is necessary to change the
schedule of the schedule)" and " Resetting to set up again "adjustment
also enters. Work volume is tripled and quadrupled.

From around the 20th day before the event, adjustment of insomnia and
sleep was started literally by the management team of Chaihuo Maker
Space and Seeed's management team literally.

A concrete example, for example, my schedule is like this.

> AM 5: 30 It is determined that the aircraft's official flight decision
> is 4 hours before the flight. Flight decisions for guests departing
> Japan for AM 9:30 are AM 5:30, confirming this and contacting Japanese
> exhibitors they arrange. (Eventually departed Japan from PM 10: 30)

> AM 9: 00 Start business Starting various companies. Do you rent
> equipment? PM 10: 30 to leave Tokyo and arrive in Hong Kong around
> 2:00 (probably, it may also be delayed) how people arrive at the hotel
> in Shenzhen, investigates the transportation that is moving now, plan
> I will contact and let them know where I will pick you up. In
> addition, it examines what it seems to be like when it is affected,
> for example, what is rental of the equipment, when it is confirmed,
> when it is affecting the scheduled work, lists it and checks with the
> manager.\
> Final judgment on whether the flight of PM 6: 30 PM 10: 30 will fly or
> not.

> PM 10: 30 Confirm the flight of the guest will be flying by contact
> from Japan.

> AM 2: 30 I heard that the guest arrived in Hong Kong. I confirmed that
> we will pick you up at the border, but due to the relationship between
> the baggage and the number of taxi riders, we will inform the hotel to
> wait.

> AM 3: 10 Confirm crossing the border.

> AM 4: 00 I'm at The hotel, welcomes you and check-in support. After
> that, the flight confirmation of the next day AM 5: 30 will be
> confirmed.

On the 22nd is the setting day, at 10am AM going to the venue and check
the status of the setting.

I feel like this, it will last from the 21st to the 24th. Because I saw
only the plan of the Japanese group, I think that the workload was small
as a whole. I'm not able to imagine how hard it was in the headquarters
that saw the whole venue.

**Overseas Maker extends Shenzhen's Maker\`s culture**

Maker Faire Shenzhen invites overseas exhibitors. Many are also invited
from Japan.\
We expects "to expand the world of Make more, not in Shenzhen".

This years invitation Maker, MakeFasion (Canada), Sandwriter Robot,
(Netherlands), Big Face(Daily Portal Z, Japan),3D planetarium(Japan),
Robot Band(Japan) , AkiParty(Japan). It was surrounded by a lot of
people, and it was dealt with in local coverage as well, so it can be
said that the committee has succeeded.

**The capital of Makers**

Shenzhen people operated Maker Faire as enthusiasm and their own
pleasure.\
There were many chaos and pleasure there. We shared "Like Maker Faire
being made".

I think Shenzhen is the capital of Makers. However, I do not agree with
the opinion that "Shenzhen has things".\
Shenzhen has People. Shenzhen has them and gathers those who love Making
the most from all over the world. Of course, culture and business way,
all of the city is for MAKERS.

That is why I think that it is the capital of Makers.
