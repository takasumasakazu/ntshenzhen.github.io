*Japanese Maker Pro (Indie Hardware) is grown
rapidly.*medium.com](https://medium.com/shenzhen-high-tour-by-makers/japanesemakerpro-b788f1ba96f "https://medium.com/shenzhen-high-tour-by-makers/japanesemakerpro-b788f1ba96f"){.markup--anchor

Hardware startup is more than full time job. Crowdfunding, which once
appeared on the extension line of hobby, became a pre-sales platform for
hardware startups.\
But Maker Pro is Maker's life itself. When you put your booth to the
Maker Faire, if someone keeps the booth while going to the toilet, the
booth is not yours alone.

And I told that theme on the event, FOSS ASIA 2018.\
Tech for fun community and culture

That theme, indie design and Maker Pro\`s are quite important for me, I
will continue to explore what that can do.

I will organize again the meet up in Shenzhen, please see you there.\
