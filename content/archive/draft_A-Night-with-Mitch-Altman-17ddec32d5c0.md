A Night with Mitch Altman

Mitch Altman, He is great hacker, one of the famous gurus of the Hacker
Space movement, and my old friend. We often met hacker event on the
glove.

He came Tokyo July 2016, Fabcafe Shibuya produces event with us. That
was the reason why we talk again in Tokyo.

Mitch, I and Emery from Tokyo Hackerspace, we told How to create a
Hackerspace each other.

That was so good time.
