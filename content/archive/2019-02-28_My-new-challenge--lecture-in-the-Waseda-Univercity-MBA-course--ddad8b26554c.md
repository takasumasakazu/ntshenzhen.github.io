### My new challenge, lecture in the Waseda Univercity MBA course. TAKASU & Nico-Tech Shenzhen Community Monthly news Mar/2019 {#dd60 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="dd60"}

Takaku just back to Shenzhen, Back to the future, back to busy
days.Finally, I ended my CNY holiday in the Philippines.

Pre-holiday, I was working in Japan for Waseda Univercity, teach about
Maker Ecosystem and Social rights. That is so challenging for me,
because I was so lazy student and my graduate my small university in
1997, yes that is 20th century!

That's mean old lazy student teach to passionate 21st century student,
sounds like little crazy.

However, my 15 slot lecture causes some phenomenon. They student will
come to Shenzhen in this March, and some people make something of my
own. They are able to understand what is the Maker, How to be Maker Pro,
and Why Shenzhen is amazing.

They offer me lecturer one more season, I still challenge for the
student at Feb 2020.

Now I just backed to Shenzhen, back to the Makers, And study again
Chinese on Shenzhen University.
