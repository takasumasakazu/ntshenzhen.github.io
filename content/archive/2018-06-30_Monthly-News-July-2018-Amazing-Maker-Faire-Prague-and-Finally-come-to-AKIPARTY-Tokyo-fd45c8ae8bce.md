One week in Shenzhen like a month. But my time was more accelerated.
I\`m away from Shenzhen now, in Dublin airport. This trip around a
month, that kind of trips are thrid times in this year.

I will back to Shenzhen on 10th July.

This trip I saw a couple of Maker Faire, Barcelona and Prague. My first
step in Barcelona was a fantastic experience, I fall in love with that
city. The tech activity is few, not my style and so far from Shenzhen.
However, I saw Fablab Barcelona, Green Fablab, SOKO maker space, these
looks well.

Barcelona

Add while the next city Maker Faire Prague, that's quite positive
surprise! Startups, DIY, craft and Makerspace, I could see a whole of
the maker movement in 2 days, I saw just a MAKER FAIRE!

Maker Faire Prague

I really respect to Joseph Prusa, Denisa Kara and the all of the staff.

Finally, I head up to Maker Faire Tokyo and Singapore.

I spend a so much time for AKIPARTY 2018, on 4th August at AKIHABARA
Tokyo.

See you there!

I told about the new innovation ecosystem in Shenzhen by English and
Chinese, this is my newest talk video.
