ChiangMai well known beautiful and historical city, at north of the
Thailand. There is not only ensient city but also creative city by
international people. That unique combination between intelligent local
people and international creator they still existing happen. I will tell
that social environment and result.

Chiang Mai is really a creative city by international people. There have
some function such as cheep and safety, small cozy town and exciting
creative community, exotic Asian town and intelligent local citizen.
Their issues are opposed each other, but Chiang Mai still keeps
satisfied any function. You are able to see both of community that the
creative international community of nomad workers, engineers and
designers, and intelligent Thai peoples community of ChiangMai
university.

They are helping each other in same creative ecosystems in town. That is
the reason why good cafe, co-working place and maker community in
ChiangMai.

In conclusion, I learned from them that, every Makers can make
innovation in Maker ecosystem. Every city having own culture for a
unique, exciting Maker project. I'm belongings that ecosystem, I told my
experience saw a lot of Maker Movement around the world.
