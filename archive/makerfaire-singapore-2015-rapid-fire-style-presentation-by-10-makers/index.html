In MakerFaire Singapore 2015, We made NicoNico Gakkai Beta Style presentation.\nThat is only 3 min presentation by makers, more focusing and more compressive theme, These are very good introduction of Singapore makers.\n01 Robotic platform — Asratec\nAsratec from Japan, they made Operating system for Robot.\nDifferent size, style, brands robot controlled by same interface, when use them Operation System V-Sido.\n02 Bikes 4 Fun\nBikes 4 Fun started in 2006 when the team started collecting unique homemade bicycles.\nThey became a full-fledged business when they started making bicycles themselves while based in New Zealand. Currently, Bikes 4 Fun are now operating out of their workshop in Kaki Bukit and will be in Singapore for the next two years before they bring our bicycles on an international tour again.\n03 Scottie Crafts — Alice\nMy passion for handicraft began in 2003 after I attended the Perth Royal Show in Australia. This annual community event showcases Western Australia’s agriculture, small businesses and entertainment and the wide array of exhibits include arts, handicrafts, animals, photography, local produce, cooking demonstration, performances as well as competitions. The wide variety of handicrafts on display left a deep impression on me. It was an eye opener as I discovered that one can create beautiful crafts using simple materials such as paper, ribbons, fabric and cinnamon sticks! I enrolled in handicraft classes and began making gifts for my family and friends and I have not looked back since. At ScottieCrafts, all the gifts and cards are created with love and can be customised or personalised according to your preferences. Feel free to email me at scottiecrafts@gmail.com for any queries or orders. Have a great day!\n04 Paper Quilling — Priyanka\nIf you are interested to find out more about the craft of quilling, come by Priyanka’s maker booth at the Senja-Cashew CC this weekend or attend her workshops which will be conducted at 4.45pm — 5.15pm on both days. More about Priyanka can also be found at her “Just Love Crafts” blog{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor} and Facebook Page{.markup–anchor .markup–p-anchor}.\n05 Chorustext\nChorusText aims to provide an alternative to conventional text editing and reading, by shifting the activity from visual-based to “tactile-and-audial-based.”\nInstead of a screen, it has a surface populated with moving sliders, dials and buttons; And instead of staring at the screen to read the text, the user gets to physically slide knobs, turn dials and press buttons. The underlying software keeps track of the position of the knobs and status of the buttons, converts the text to synthesized speech accordingly, and plays it through the speaker. The result is a system that reads text in response to the user’s tactile / physical inputs. When the text changes,such as from insertion of new text typed from the keyboard, the sliders will also reposition themselves to reflect the new content of the text.\n06 Hackerspace Singapore\nHackerspace.SG is Singapore’s very own Hackerspace.\nThere are hundreds of such hackerspaces around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, science, digital and electronic art, come together to meet, socialise and collaborate.\nBuilt by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, Hackerspace.SG is the Singapore hacker community’s home, living room and laboratory. Come hang out with the community in the evenings. Co-work with us during the day. We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.\nHSG was Singapore’s first co-working space. Since we launched, many more have appeared — see e27's list of co-working spaces in Singapore.\n07 Singapore Poly — SJ Teo\nThis is the fourth year Singapore Polytechnic (SP) is taking part in Maker Faire as a group. This year, SP is taking part with project showcases from staff and student makers.\n08 Learn to work with glass\nTalented glass artist Anjali Venkat will be at Maker Faire Singapore over 2 days, giving demonstrations and workshops on how to cut, color and grout glass.\n09 IoT in your home — May — Renaissance Engineering Programme — it conflicts with your workshop, let us know if there is an issue\nMakers’ Lab is formed by a group of passionate NTU students who furthers the Makers movement in their school community. Some of the past projects and workshops they have done include making a LED cube powered by Arduino, making the furthest-flying glider out of balsa wood and making an Android app. Today, they are here with us to introduce and demo some IoT apps they have made in their spare time.\n10 David — Steampunk art\nBy TAKASU Masakazu/高須正和{.p-author .h-card} on July 17, 2015.\nCanonical link Exported from Medium on February 6, 2026.\n","wordCount":"805","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://takasumasakazu.github.io/archive/makerfaire-singapore-2015-rapid-fire-style-presentation-by-10-makers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://takasumasakazu.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/ accesskey=h title="ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website (Alt + H)">ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/teardown/ title=Teardown><span>Teardown</span></a></li><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/shenzhen/ title=Shenzhen><span>Shenzhen</span></a></li><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/years/ title=Years><span>Years</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/archive/>Archive</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">MakerFaire Singapore 2015 Rapid fire style presentation by 10 Makers.</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2015-07-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 17, 2015</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>4 min</span></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#makerfaire-singapore-2015-rapid-fire-style-presentation-by-10makers aria-label="MakerFaire Singapore 2015 Rapid fire style presentation by 10 Makers.">MakerFaire Singapore 2015 Rapid fire style presentation by 10 Makers.</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In MakerFaire Singapore 2015, We made NicoNico Gakkai Beta Style
