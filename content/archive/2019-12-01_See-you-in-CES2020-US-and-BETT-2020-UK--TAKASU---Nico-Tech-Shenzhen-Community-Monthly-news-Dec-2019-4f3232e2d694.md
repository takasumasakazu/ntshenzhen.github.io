This is Takasu, really long time no see. I\`m not able to send updates
on Oct and Nov, This email is behind 3 months. Now I back to Shenzhen
already, in this Dec I need a trip to ChiangMai and Japan, these only 2
trips are so little then last few months.

But I haven't been any problem with my activity, still enjoy the trip
and struggle.

I send my update to the next, I will CES 2020 from 2nd Jan-10th Jan.
Because press day and save air ticket fee. My home Shenzhen is hardware
capital, so rush to the load to CES, I have to escape from peak time.

And also to go Maker Faire Bangkok, that is quite nice Maker Faire
there, I love it.

Then, I will go to BETT on UK, I still am leaning what is the STEM and
how does STEM community.

After BETT, I will go again Tokyo and give the 2 weeks Lecture on WASEDA
university about Maker Ecosystem.

If you come CES, BETT, or Maker Faire Bangkok, lets chat and take selfie
with me.

Best

Takasu
