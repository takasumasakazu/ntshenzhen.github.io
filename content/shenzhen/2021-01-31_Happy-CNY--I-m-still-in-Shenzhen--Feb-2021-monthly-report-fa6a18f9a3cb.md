### Happy CNY, I\`m still in Shenzhen. Feb/2021 monthly report

This is TAKASU.\
Long time no see!\
I\`m in Shenzhen and happy busy days.

You know, the current Covid-19 situation is not so good, Here Shenzhen
is the safest in the world, with only a few carriers per day in 15
million people. But China government announced so strict regulations
about domestic transport, I\`m not able to go out from Shenzhen. Of
course, international trip too.

I agree with that announcement, the time has come for staying home. I
will enjoy spring cleaning for my room and enjoy spring food from this
fruitful area around southern China...

I hope to see you again and surely hope to stay safe.

Best\
Takasu
