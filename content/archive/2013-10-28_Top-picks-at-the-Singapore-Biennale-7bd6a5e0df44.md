1\. PEACE CAN BE REALISED EVEN WITHOUT ORDER by Team Lab (Singapore Art
Museum). The Biennale's best "wow" moment comes from this Japanese art
collective, which takes over the museum's third floor space. One enters
the dark room and is immediately overwhelmed by what seems like an
endless group of traditional musicians and dancers, holograms that react
to your presence via motion sensors as you tentatively walk around and
immerse yourself in its uplifting, celebratory vibe.
