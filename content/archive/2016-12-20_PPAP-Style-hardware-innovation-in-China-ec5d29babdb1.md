### PPAP Style hardware innovation in China {#ebe4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="ebe4"}

In China and Shenzhen, due to the distribution of intermediate products
such as GongBan (Public PCBA) and GongMo (Public Mold), design and
manufacturing time and cost are also decreasing. As a result, many new
products are invented in an incredibly short period of time.

There are many imitations with many logos of famous brands such as Apple
and BOSE, but there are also many new products not seen elsewhere.\
It is like PPAP invented by a combination of existing products.

While ordinary mobile phones take about two years to develop and tens of
thousands are made, mobile phones made in this way are mass-produced in
two months and seem to be distributed from around 1000 pieces.\
In Shenzhen there is a daily new product advertisement issued, and every
time I walk 華強北(HuaQiangBei) every day I can find something new.\
Finally, 360 cam GongBan and GongMo were posted today. You will soon see
a new product with 360 CAM built into everything.
