### My first trip to Manila, for Maker Faire! TAKASU & Nico-Tech Shenzhen Community Monthly news June/2019 {#7f6b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="7f6b"}

I had a good rest in Shenzhen in these few weeks, after Maker Faire Bay
Area. MFBA this year became a bit smaller by a financial issue, but
still beautiful. I heard from Dale about the issue, sounds a bit
difficult, but I surely play for the continue the faire.

I saw the many people in MFBA and say hi again, there is still only one
place of the world.

My next event is Mini Maker Faire Manila in June, CES Asia, and
Nico-Tech Kanazawa. These looks are so interesting and MMF Manila and
