I met Humanoid robot called Nadine. That is research project by Prof
Nadia at [Instutitute for Media
Innovation](http://imi.ntu.edu.sg/AboutIMI/Pages/vision.aspx){.markup--anchor

University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx){.markup--anchor

![I misunderstood that robot is Prof Nadia, the first time meet
Humanoid Nadine.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3A8-SZs7QMsaBnv_v9WQAw.jpeg)

That robot project organized prof Nadia,that aim to make another new
human being. Nadine have Artificial Intelligence brain, she can talk
with human, and more leanning new thing from experience. \
Her eyes are still Kinect V2 Camera, also ears are a microphone, I have
to grab a microphone when I speak to Nadia. However, these are just
developing now for the communication.

"Nadine will have more predict hand by next project. She will be able to
grab something and play a table game such as chess with human." Prof
Nadia told me. That means more deeply communication with human by hand.

Geminoid project by prof Kazuo Ishiguro is another famous humanoid
project. I saw his project, I think that aim to 'Copy' the whole of The
person to Robot, includes character, personality, and physical
appearance.\
Instead of Nadine project, current Nadiene has similar prof Nadia's
appearance, but that personality is Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nadine
project aiming to 'New' person.

Nadia's lab made another AI robot too, without physical appearance, only
in the display robot.

![Sane eyes, ears, and brain as Nadia, expect
phigical body.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zi_3ahNUuaG-WxMzOrFzrg.jpeg)

That AI robot on the display, some time interaction for me, smiling and
move her hand and body. These are smoother than Nadine. Nadine need huge
air compressor system, can't go out her room, but that system is able to
go around. That robot is not only Nadine limited version.

Prof. Nadine's research projects cause more deelply thinking to WHAT IS
A HUMAN.

Prof.Nadia.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zQHNmOJrn65LXrdx5fbhhg.jpeg)
