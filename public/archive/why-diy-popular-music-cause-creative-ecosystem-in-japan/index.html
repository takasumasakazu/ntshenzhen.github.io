For represented example HATSUNE MIKU, that software made Google theme song, such as famous singer Lady Gaga. That tune ‘Tell your world’ played almost 5 million times.\nGoogle Chrome Theme song [Tell your world]\nIn fact, that HATSUNE MIKU and any Vocaloid are just voice synthesizing software, like other Synthesizer play by musician such as Daft punk. Apart from other software, Vocaloid was a singing a song with lyric. That cause big movement in Japan, a lot of DIY tune makers born in Japan, and over thousands professional quality music video shared in Japanese video sharing service. Indeed, you can see that creative collaboration ecosystem in these Vocaloid movements, likewise imagine open source movement. Actual HATSUNE MIKU is not an open source, technology by YAMAHA, Voice source by Voice actor Saki Fugita, product of Cripton future media. But similar software UTAU is open source, and these Vocaloid songs, making a trough of the process are very similarly culture as open source community.\n**Who made these high quality music videos? Why that creative ecosystem appears in the Japanese video sharing service?\n**This essay will try to express that.\nWhat is DIY popular music? Why Vocaloid software is important? Computer music by amateur musician and the hobbyist is not new things, you can see hobby computer music history before 1990. But typical computer musics before the Vocaloild, these songs are instrumental music, such as DJ and electro style, No singing and lyric.\nFamous computer music ‘Extra’ by Ken Ishii.\nAlmost popular music need singing with lyrics, you can find tune in hit chart, Pitbull, Coldplay, OK GO, so every popular music have singing. Vocaloid softwares cause popular music bring to the Computer music, then the hobbyist can make popular music from them only the laptop, without physical singers and band.\nHence The laptop song makers are able to make popular music tune by Vocaloid. Additionally that Vocaloid software has character and appearance, like real Singer.\nThe early days, that the character and appearance are only one picture. However, that picture combined songs and lyrics, these became a story. Next, That stories’ cause imagines people, especially other creators, such as a drawer, Movie makers, bloggers. Finally, The song makers and other creators start collaboration for making movie clip together. That is an ecosystem.\nWhat is Ecosystem? Why an Ecosystem is important? That movie structure includes beautiful movie, picture and appearance. These things by DIY but not only track maker, collaboration by three different people. Produced and music by KUROUSA-P, Illustrated by ITTOMARU, movie by MIENOHITO. They are individual hobbyist meet on the Net. You can see a lot of collaboration in Vocaloid scene, for example, that SENBON SAKURA is 24st song from KUROUSA-P.\nTypical Vocaroid song makers called ‘P’. P means Producer. He makes a song and lyric, and producing his song, also a collaboration with illustrator and movie maker to build the songs vision of the world.\nSENBON SAKURA most popular song in 2011\nThis DIY song SENBON SAKURA played million times in only 42 days, at 2011. That means so many people enjoy Vocaloid songs. In case of Karaoke in Japan in 2011, almost every hit tunes are by Vocaloid.\nThese audiences in Video sharing service, some people are able to create another song and pictures, videos. Them added on a more and more story for the original Vocaloid character. Then, HATSUNE MIKU getting a lot of stories of the songs and pictures, start from only one picture, by collaborative creation.\nCollaborative creation Music select system of democratic collaboration.\nNotable Vocaloid songs are almost 1500 songs in video sharing service. These are chosen from so many (uncountable) DIY computer music by the hobbyist song maker.\nIf you see all the songs, Probably you can find only low quality music, feel boring quickly, such as ATARI Shock.But you can find notable songs.\nHow to choose that notable songs?\nFirst, Vocaloid mania checks every uploaded song at Video sharing service. That is not so easy, because every day 100–300 per day new song uploaded in 2011 (2009–2012 are Vocaloid songs golden era) And they not only watch the song, but also they add tagging songs and make song lists and publish to the blog every day. People can see Vocaloid hit chart every day.\nSecond, listed tunes are played by so many Vocaloid listeners, mostly teenager. Finally, some song played over 100,000 times, that song called notable. Every person can make and choose any songs, that is so democratic collaboration.\n**Why people doing a collaboration for creative?\n**Example SENBON SAKURA is 24st songs by Kurousa-P. He did 24 times collaboration with illustrator and movie maker.\nWhy people doing a collaboration for creative? Of course, The create music process is sometimes fun, additionally big audience in Internet give positive power to the creators. However, that is not only fun, creators spend many time on his laptop, then sometime that effort can’t make anything. These things too hard to call only hobby.\nOtherwise, people often help each other for the purpose, indeed for the community. Vocaloid is only software, voice and simple character. Hence the creators add more story for the character. Now every famous Vocaloid has quite an attractive personality, more the every real singer. Meanwhile them Vocaloid personality is made by collaborative creation.\n**Shared Personality\n**A real singer, such as Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga’s personality is belonging them. You can’t feel own Lady Gaga’s personality. In the case of some musician give the name to them music instrument, Eric Crapton calling his guitar Layla. Otherwise that guitar Layla’s only his one.\nApart from, a Vocaloid is different. They have a personality from collaboration, and that software shared by each creator. Therefore them personality didn’t monopoly by anybody, every creator has own Singer. Vocaloid has both of apparently contradictory, they have shared personality.\nOpen collaboration ecosystem. In conclusion, the people surrounding Vocaloid are making ecosystem. They helped each other for growing ecosystem. Additionally centre of ecosystem in attractive personality of Vocalid, that is not only software synthesizer but also character. As well as them character made by collaborative creation.\nThat structure is a bit similar to open source projects, unless difference between a software and content.\nThese are not a cathedral and not a bazaar, but another kind of open collaboration ecosystem.\nBy TAKASU Masakazu/高須正和{.p-author .h-card} on March 4, 2016.\nCanonical link Exported from Medium on February 6, 2026.\n","wordCount":"1101","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://www.vocaloid.com/en/","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://takasumasakazu.github.io/archive/why-diy-popular-music-cause-creative-ecosystem-in-japan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://takasumasakazu.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/ accesskey=h title="ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website (Alt + H)">ニコ技深セン / Nico-Tech Shenzhen website</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/teardown/ title=Teardown><span>Teardown</span></a></li><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/shenzhen/ title=Shenzhen><span>Shenzhen</span></a></li><li><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/years/ title=Years><span>Years</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://takasumasakazu.github.io/archive/>Archive</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why DIY popular music cause creative ecosystem in Japan?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2016-03-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 4, 2016</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>6 min</span></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=http://www.vocaloid.com/en/ alt></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#why-diy-popular-music-cause-creative-ecosystem-injapan aria-label="Why DIY popular music cause creative ecosystem in Japan?">Why DIY popular music cause creative ecosystem in Japan?</a><ul><li><a href=#what-is-diy-popular-music-why-vocaloid-software-is-important aria-label="What is DIY popular music?
